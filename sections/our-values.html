      <h3>Customer Care</h3>
      <p>
        We're here to help you with solar panel installation in Devon and
        Cornwall. If we were to sum ourselves up in a few words, those would be
        "reliable, honest and friendly." We find our customers agree! We're with
        you from the start of the project to the finish.

      <h3>Price</h3>
      <p>
        As I'm sure you'll have seen, solar systems don't tend to come cheap.
        Our aim is to make solar power accessible to everyone, so we price
        ourselves in a way that makes solar energy more affordable. We're
        focused on helping you and on helping the environment, rather than on
        turning a profit.

      <h3>Sustainability</h3>
      <p>
        As we've said, we do this because we truly care about the planet and
        about seeing people embrace a greener, more eco-friendly approach to
        power. The world of green energy can be jargon-filled and opaque, so we
        want to help educate people on the big and little things they can do to
        protect our planet!
